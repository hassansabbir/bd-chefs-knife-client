React Authentication Assignment 10
Project name: BD Chefs Knife

In this Milestone I learned about Authentication using firebase. Using firebase authentication and react router i created this project called "BD Chefs Knife". Here is some details about the project-

- This is a simple light theme website that contains the recipe of the most brilliant chefs of Bangladesh.

- In this website you will see all the best chefs in a list of cards . You can select a single card containing a chefs name and the website will take you to a page where it contains all the best recipes of that chef.

- In chefs recipe page you can scroll down to watch the recipes, what are the ingredients and how to cook and so on. It's a great way to learn about the secrets of the best chefs, don't you think?...

- In all the recipe cards at the bottom of the items there you will find a button called "Add To favorite", if you click that button the recipe will be added to your favorites list and you will see this in a toast message. After click the button will be disabled.

- In this Website if you are not logged in and you try to go to chefs recipe pages the site will take you to login page where you have o login to watch the recipes.

- If you don't have an account to login, at the bottom of the login form you will find the link to register page where you can create your own account.

- You can create your account using your name, photo URL, your email and password. You have to choose your password carefully because if your password is not at least 6 characters the site will show you an error message. And also , you have to fill all the input field to complete the registration of your account.

- after creating an account you can login by your email and password. You can also login by your google and github account.

* After successfully login you will be able to see all the recipes from the chefs recipe page. At the right end of the navbar you will be able to see your profile photo and the interesting part is , if you hover your profile photo, website will show you your name from the logged in account.

* There is a page named "Blogs", where you can find some answers of some frequently asked questions. If you want to save the question and answer section, there is a button at the top of the page called "Generate PDF". By clicking this button website will make a PDF file of the blogs page and download it in your browser.

* The Home page is fully responsive.

* I used some photo for decorating the website , and it looks very vibrant in my eyes. I used some reasonable banner and footer in the website.
